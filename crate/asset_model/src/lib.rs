//! Provides types to reference asset configuration and entities.
//!
//! This crate contains the types necessary to reference assets configuration from the file system.
//! It does not contain the types that represent actual configuration. Those are provided by the
//! respective configuration crates.
//!
//! For example, this crate contains the [`AssetIndex`][asset_index] type, which stores where object
//! configuration is, but does not contain `ObjectType` or types for the various object types.
//!
//! This crate also does not provide the logic to discover the configuration on disk. That is
//! provided by the `asset_loading` crate.
//!
//! [asset_index]: config/struct.AssetIndex.html
